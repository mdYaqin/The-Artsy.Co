## App Features

*  New User can see lists of errands posted at the Homepage
* Clicking on a picture on the homepage, will go to the individual Errand's page, which will have a full description of the errand, location maps as well as the seller's ratings and reviews from past transactions.

<!-- *  After successful login/register , User can accept these errands. Users can also like the errands ( the Hearts at the bottom of each card ) which they want to shortlist or actually like. When liked, it will be under the user's likes and it will be reflected in his dashboard so that he can refer to his likes to go back to any errands that he previously liked.  
![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79918648/127741430-11ce0c9b-22af-4a59-8252-a11620c57bc3.jpg)



* They can also have a chat with the seller, in real-time, to ask more details about the errand. The chat utilises socket.io to pass the messages instantly and mongoDB to store the conversations and messages

* User can also created their own errands for acceptance. When creating these errands, they will have to pay upfront the cost of the errand as well as the actual costs of the items (if any). The payment uses stripe gateway and upon successful payment, it will be reflected in their wallet. These errands will also be reflected in their dashboard for easy reference.

*  Upon completion of errand, the amount of the whole errand is transferred from the seller's wallet to the buddy's wallet. An email is sent to both user and buddy. This uses nodemailer. 
* User can then submit review and ratings of the other user which will be reflected in user's dashboard.


#### Layout of website
* Bootstap and material ui frameworks were used to complement the css.
* The website was made to be mobile friendly (in progress).

#### Authentication
* Authentication is done by using jsonwebtoken and localstorage stores the token for authenticating the client side routes, where needed.
* Reset password uses jsonwebtoken to send a link, through nodemailer, that is valid for a short period of time.

#### Uploading of files
Images are uploaded to cloudinary using multer and streamify, so as to minimise any local disk storage: https://cloudinary.com/blog/node_js_file_upload_to_a_local_server_or_to_the_cloud
* A cloudinary id was included in errand schemas to faciliate the deletion of previous images whenever there is an update to the image or the errand is deleted.
